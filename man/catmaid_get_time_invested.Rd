\title{Calculates the time individual users have spent working on a set of neurons
This API is a replica of the get_time_invested from python package `pymaid`
Use @param minimum_actions and @param max_inactive_time to fine tune how time
invested is calculated: by default, time is binned over 3 minutes in which a given user 
has to perform 3x10 actions for that interval to be counted as active.
 @mode can be one of 'SUM' or 'OVER_TIME' or 'ACTIONS'
'SUM' will return total time invested (in minutes) per user.
'OVER_TIME' will return minutes invested/day over time.
'ACTIONS' will return actions (node/connectors placed/edited) per day, for this the minimum_actions and 
max_inactive_time don't apply and hence every action is counted}
\usage{
catmaid_get_time_invested(skids, pid = 1, conn = NULL,
  mode = c("SUM", "OVER_TIME", "ACTIONS"), minimum_actions = 10,
  max_inactive_time = 3, treenodes = TRUE, connectors = TRUE,
  start_date = "2005-01-01", end_date = "2099-01-01", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{skids}{could be skeleton id or neuron name or annotation}

\item{pid}{the project id}

\item{conn}{CATMAID connection instance}

\item{mode}{can be one of 'SUM','OVER_TIME','ACTIONS', where 'SUM' will return
the total time invested (in minutes), 'OVER_TIME' returns minutes invested per day over
time, 'ACTIONS' returns actions (node/connectors placed/edited) performed per day}

\item{minimum_actions}{the minimum number of actions per minute to be counted as active.}

\item{max_inactive_time}{Interval in minutes over which time invested is binned. Essentially determines how much time can be between bouts of activity.}

\item{treenodes}{Whether tree nodes need to be taken into account or not}

\item{connectors}{Whether connectors need to be taken into account or not}

\item{start_date}{The start date to compute activity from}

\item{end_date}{The end date to compute end of activity at}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the \code{\link{catmaid_fetch}} 
function}
}
